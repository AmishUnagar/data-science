    "A database is a collection of organized and structured data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. It can be stored and retrieved from a computer or server. Databases are used in many fields, including business, education, healthcare, and more. They are crucial for managing and organizing data in a way that is efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, while NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL. Here are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases have a predefined data structure, which means the data is stored in tables with fixed columns and rows. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not have a fixed data structure, and the data is stored in a flexible and dynamic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying Language: SQL databases use SQL as their querying language, which is a standardized language used to manage relational databases. NoSQL databases use different querying languages depending on the type of database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they can only handle more data by increasing the hardware resources. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means they can handle more data by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: SQL databases have a strong consistency model, which means that data is always consistent and up-to-date. NoSQL databases have a weaker consistency model, which means that data may not always be consistent, but this is often a trade-off for increased performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: SQL databases are often used for transactional applications, such as banking and e-commerce. NoSQL databases are often used for non-transactional applications, such as big data and real-time data processing."

    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object such as a table or view. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"department\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all rows from a table without deleting the table structure itself. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
