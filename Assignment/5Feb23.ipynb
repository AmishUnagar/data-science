    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and providing access to its functionality through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps to keep the complexity of a program under control by keeping the implementation details of an object hidden from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class. It enables code reusability and helps to create a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms. It allows objects of different types to be treated as if they are the same type. Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details and focusing on the essential features of an object. It is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a way to define the essential features of an object without specifying its implementation details."
