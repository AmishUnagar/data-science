    "\"w\" - write mode: This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated (deleted) and the file pointer will be placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" - append mode: This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file, and new data is written at the end of the existing data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" - exclusive creation mode: This mode is used to create a new file. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError exception will be raised.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"+\" - read and write mode: This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. This is useful when you want to modify an existing file."

    "In Python, the close() function is used to close an opened file. It is important to close a file after you are done working with it because it releases the resources being held by the file, such as the memory used to buffer data from the file. Not closing the file may lead to data corruption or loss, particularly if you are writing to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, Python uses system resources to create an object that represents the file in memory. If you don't close the file when you are done with it, the system resources used to create the object will remain allocated, leading to memory leaks over time. Closing the file ensures that the resources allocated to the file are released and made available for other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important reason to close a file is to ensure that any data you have written to the file is flushed from the buffer and written to disk. If you don't close the file, there is a risk that some of the data you have written to the file may not be saved, particularly if there is a system crash or power failure."

    "Notice that unlike the first two implementations, there is no need to call file.close() when using with statement. The with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. An exception during the file.write() call in the first implementation can prevent the file from closing properly which may introduce several bugs in the code, i.e. many changes in files do not go into effect until the file is properly closed. The second approach in the above example takes care of all the exceptions but using the with statement makes the code compact and much more readable. Thus, with statement helps avoiding bugs and leaks by ensuring that a resource is properly released when the code using the resource is completely executed. The with statement is popularly used with file streams, as shown above and with Locks, sockets, subprocesses and telnets etc."
