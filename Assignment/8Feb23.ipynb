    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOPs) that focuses on the essential features of an object and hides the implementation details from the user. In simpler terms, abstraction helps to create a simplified view of an object or system that only reveals the necessary information and hides the unnecessary complexities.\n",

An abstract class cannot be instantiated, but it can be subclassed. A subclass of an abstract class must implement all the abstract methods in the superclass. On the other hand, an interface is a collection of abstract methods that defines a set of behaviors. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface."

    "Here are some ways to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the relevant information through methods. By encapsulating data, we can ensure that data is only accessible through a specific interface, which makes it easier to maintain and modify the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures: Use data structures like arrays, lists, and dictionaries to abstract data. Data structures provide a simplified interface to access data by grouping related data elements into a single data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Use classes to abstract data and behavior. Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects that have properties and methods. By using classes, we can create an abstraction layer between the application and the data storage, which makes it easier to modify the data storage implementation without affecting the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interfaces: Use interfaces to provide a contract for accessing data. An interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement. By using interfaces, we can ensure that the application can interact with different data sources using the same interface, which improves the flexibility and extensibility of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, achieving data abstraction requires careful design and implementation of software components. By using encapsulation, data structures, classes, and interfaces, we can create a simplified and flexible interface for accessing complex data structures."
